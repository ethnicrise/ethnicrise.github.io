   <p class="prose">This conversation features historians Elizabeth Manley (Xavier University) and Edward Paulino (John Jay College of Criminal Justice), who reflect on the contributions Lorgia García Peña's <em>The Borders of Dominicanidad</em> makes to the growing field of Dominican Studies. They also address the way the book draws attention to the crucial place of the Dominican Republic and Haiti in histories of the Caribbean, Latin America, and the African Diaspora. Both build from García Peña's insistence that studies of the Dominican Republic move "from the footnote to the center of the page," and what this means in relation to archival work.</p>

   <p class="prose">In this exchange  Urayoán Noel (NYU) and Rachel Afi Quinn (U. Houston) Quinn examine the innovative methods of Lorgia García Peña’s <em>The Borders of Dominicanidad</em>. Urayoán Noel highlights the methodology of entering the margins of U.S. and Dominican national archives, which he calls the “Lorgian Margin,” and Rachel Afi Quinn highlights the self-reflexivity of this methodology, pointing to the ways that Lorgia García Peña’s own voice and embodied experience come under self-scrutiny in the text.</p>

   <p class="prose">In this strong exchange, Frances Negrón-Muntaner (Columbia U.) and Roopika Risam (Salem State U.) discuss why Ethnic Studies now. Negrón-Muntaner discusses how universities approach Ethnic Studies as a threat precisely because Ethnic Studies seeks to overturn the status quo as an “insurrection” from within and without. Roopika Risam continues in the same vein by outlining the imbrication of the university and racial capitalism and declaring the university as we know it “indefensible.”</p>

## Roundtable

### December 2019 -- January 2020

Why Ethnic Studies now? What is it? Why is it important?  We invited a team of distinguished and experienced scholars from diverse backgrounds to engage each other around these questions. We also asked them to reflect on the relationship of Ethnic Studies to Transnational and Hemispheric American Studies and other established interdisciplinary fields of study—Black Studies, Latinx Studies, Caribbean Studies—and last but not least, to illuminate the nature of Dr. Lorgia García Peña’s timely and original contribution to these fields.

The exchanges happened between two or three scholars in dialogue with each other. To read the exchanges click below.

## Roundtable

<h3>In Progress</h3>


Why Ethnic Studies now? What is it? Why is it important?  We have invited a team of distinguished and experienced scholars from diverse backgrounds to engage each other around these questions. We have also asked them to reflect on the relationship of Ethnic Studies to Transnational and Hemispheric American Studies and other established interdisciplinary fields of study—Black Studies, Latinx Studies, Caribbean Studies—and last but not least, to illuminate the nature of Dr. Lorgia García Peña’s timely and original contribution to these fields.

The exchanges are happening in paired and moderated email conversations, as we speak. The conversations are being curated and uploaded to this site as they come in. Moderated comments will be open for a limited time after publication to allow the public to participate in the conversation. <!-- To read the exchanges click below.

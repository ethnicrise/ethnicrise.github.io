We would like to thank Frances Negrón-Muntaner, Yolanda Martínez-San Miguel, Rosemary Feal, Laurent Dubois, Kaiama Glover and Massiel Torres for feedback and support on this project. Our deepest gratitude to Roopika Risam for her tireless work behind the scenes reaching out to the press, and helping us promote the event. To all of our roundtable participants for helping enrich the conversation in times like these, our admiration and respect. We extend a special thank you note to Ken Wissoker, Courtney Berger, Michael McCullough and Duke University Press for launching a promotion on <em>Borders of Dominicanidad</em> to coincide with our project. To Centro Bono for sharing the spanish introduction to the book prior to publication. Many other collaborators will surely make this what we hope. We thank you in advance. And last, but not least, we would like to thank Lorgia García Peña herself for her tireless work.

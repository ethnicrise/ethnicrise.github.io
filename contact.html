We would like to thank Frances Negrón-Muntaner, Yolanda Martínez-San Miguel, Rosemary Feal, Laurent Dubois, Kaiama Glover, and Massiel Torres for feedback and support on this project. We extend a special thank you note to Ken Wissoker, Courtney Berger, Michael McCullough and Duke University Press for launching a promotion on <em>Borders of Dominicanidad</em> to coincide with our project. Many other collaborators will surely make this what we hope. We thank you in advance. And last, but not least, we would like to thank Lorgia García Peña for her work.

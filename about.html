## About

Welcome. "Ethnic Studies Rise" is a public humanities effort to honor the extraordinary contributions of scholar Dr. Lorgia García Peña: First, by defending and helping the public understand the importance of Ethnic Studies, which García Peña has worked tirelessly for throughout her distinguished career—this is the goal of our <a href="#roundtable">Roundtable</a>; and Second, by celebrating, re-centering, and bringing a discussion of her work to wider audiences—this is the goal of our <a href="#lorgiafest">LorgiaFest.</a> We hope that in honoring Dr. García Peña, we also recognize and honor all of those Ethnic Studies scholars who have encountered resistance and retaliation for their timely work in the United States, and to the students who need them and fight daily to belong.

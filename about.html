## About

With this public exercise, we hope to honor the extraordinary contribution of Dr. Lorgia García Peña in two ways: First by defending and helping the public understand the Ethnic Studies that García Peña has worked hard to help build herself. This is the goal of our <a href="#roundtable">Roundtable</a>; and Second, by celebrating, re-centering, and bringing a discussion of her work to wider audiences. This is the goal of our <a href="#lorgiafest">LorgiaFest.</a>

The project was conceived of and brought to fruition by Raj Chetty (St. John's University) and Katerina Gonzalez Seligmann (Emerson College), in collaboration with Alex Gil (Columbia University).
